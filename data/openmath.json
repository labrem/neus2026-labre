      "description": "This CD defines permutations with finite support.\n\nIn order to make available permutations of arbitrary objects,\npermutations are defined as sets of cycles.\n\nThe set on which the permutation acts is not specified. To this end,\ncycles of length 0 or 1 do not occur in permutations.\n\nWhen viewed as the set of cycles which are its arguments, the symbol\npermutation has a normal form constructor.\n\nAll symbols defined in this CD may appear as the head of an\napplication.  For such symbols, we distinguish between functions and\nconstructors.  A function is thought of as a mathematical function,\nwhich can be evaluated on its arguments, a constructor uses its\narguments as fields of a structure. (In principle, the arguments of a constructor should\nbe accessible; we have not introduced separate symbols to enable\naccess because the `destruction' of the mathematical object can take place in phrasebooks.)\n\nThe constructors in this CD are cycle, permutation, list_perm, and endomap.\n\nThe operations inverse, left_compose, right_compose are also defined\nin this CD, although the most general purpose version already occurs\nin fns1, fns2. The reasons is two-fold: first, strictly\nspeaking, our permutations are not maps, and so these notions havfe to\nredefined.  A more practical reason is that with dynamical loading, it\nis easier to encode and decode a new symbol in the CD at hand rather\nthan a symbol in a CD that is previously dealt with.\n\nRevision 0.1: fix added; error in support example corrected.\nRevision 0.2: added endomap.
